# WeatherAndEmail
get the weather from accuweather.com and send it to people in an email

The first python script, Accu_Weather_Denver.py takes two other files as input. One file specifies the API key you received from accuwather.com.
The second file it takes is what location you want to look up weathe for. Location is specified by location id that can be looked up at the accuwether website.

The second python scrip, Get_Weather_Send_Email.py takes multiple file as input, but only one has to be created by the user prior to running the program.
There is an email metadata file where users should put the email account they will be logging into, the password of said account, and the recepient email address of this 
weather update. The other input files are generated by Accu_Weather_Denver.py, so don't need to be created or manipulated by the user.
